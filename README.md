AngularDraft with Grunt
============
## "npm install"
- This command will install all the dependencies inside the **package.json** needed for Grunt, and Grunt Task's to run. 

## "grunt"
- Run at least 1 time the command **grunt**, and after that the working project will be created in the folder 'dest/..'. 
- Delete the **deleteble** folder inside the **'dest/..'** folder.

## "npm install http-server -g"
- This command will install the http-server globally.
- For the app to work you need a http-server and if you dont have one installed, this command will fix that.<br/>
- Check more documentation about http-server here: https://github.com/nodeapps/http-server <br/>


## "http-server"
- From inside the aplications folder, run the **http-server** command to start the simple http-server on that folder.
